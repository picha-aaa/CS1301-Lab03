Asteroid Risk Analysis Web App — NASA NeoWs + Gemini LLM | Python, Streamlit
-Built an interactive Streamlit web app integrating NASA’s NeoWs API with Google Gemini LLM to analyze and explain near-Earth asteroid risks.
-Designed and implemented real-time data pipelines, custom physics-based risk-scoring algorithms, and interactive visualizations.
-Developed an LLM-powered chatbot capable of answering user questions using live asteroid data.
-Applied best practices for API security, environment variables, and session-state management.


Achievements:
-Developed a multi-page full-stack Streamlit application
-Integrated external REST APIs and parsed real-time JSON data
-Created physics-informed risk-scoring models (size, velocity, distance, hazard flags)
-Implemented interactive charts for asteroid risk insights
-Built LLM workflows using Google Gemini for explanations and user interaction
